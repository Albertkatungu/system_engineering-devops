This project focuses on understanding and managing file permissions in Linux, a key component of system security. Learners will explore the basics of file ownership, user roles, and permission settings, including changing permissions for files and directories. Through hands-on tasks, students will practice setting, modifying, and verifying permissions, ensuring they are well-versed in controlling access to files and directories within the Linux command line.



Instructions
Start by completing the quiz you see below. Once you complete the quiz, you can see the activity tasks mentioned in these instructions.
Complete the tasks one by one and follow the submission instructions below to submit your solution to the tasks.


How to Submit
Repository and Directory Setup
Ensure you have a GitHub account set up. If you are new to GitHub, use the GitHub website (https://github.com) to create your repository and upload files.
Create a new repository named system_engineering-devops.
Inside this repository, create a directory called 0x01-shell_permissions where all your script files for this project will be stored.
Adding Files for Each Task
Each task requires a unique script file. Create each script in the 0x01-shellpermissions directory, using the exact file names provided in each task description (e.g., 0-iambetty, 1-whoami).
Make sure each script is executable. You can set file permissions directly on GitHub or, if using the command line, run:
bash
chmod +x filename
Submitting Your Project
Once all files are uploaded to the GitHub repository, verify that your directory structure and filenames match the requirements.
Using GitHub UI (Preferred Method)
You can easily create or upload files through GitHub’s web interface by clicking “Add file” > “Upload files” in your project directory.
For learners comfortable with the command line, feel free to use git commands to interact with GitHub.
