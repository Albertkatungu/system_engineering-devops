How to Submit

1. Repository and Directory Setup

Ensure you have a GitHub account set up. If you are new to GitHub, use the GitHub website (https://github.com) to create your repository and upload files.
Create a new repository named system_engineering-devops.
Inside this repository, create a directory called 0x00-shell_basics where all your script files for this project will be stored and ensure that you have a README.md file in the directory.
2. Adding Files for Each Task

Each task requires a unique script file. Create each script in the 0x00-shell_basics directory, using the exact file names provided in each task description (e.g., 0-current_working_directory).
3. Submitting Your Project

Once all files are uploaded to the GitHub repository, verify that your directory structure and filenames match the requirements.
4. Using GitHub UI (Preferred Method)

You can easily upload files through GitHub’s web interface by clicking “Add file” > “Upload files” in your project directory.
For learners comfortable with the command line, feel free to use git commands to interact with GitHub.
