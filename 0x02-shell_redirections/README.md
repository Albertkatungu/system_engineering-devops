Important!
This is a graded project assignment that will contribute 12.5% to your overall grade. You must complete all the tasks provided after the quiz to ensure that you’re completing this assignment project. Each task contains its own set of instructions, so review them carefully.

This project introduces learners to input and output redirections and essential text-processing commands in Linux. Through hands-on tasks, students will gain practical experience in redirecting command output, reading from files, and using common filters like cat, head, tail, sort, and uniq. By the end of this project, learners will be able to control where output goes, manage errors, and combine commands with pipes for efficient data processing.

How to Submit
Repository and Directory Setup
Ensure you have a GitHub account set up. If you are new to GitHub, use the GitHub website (https://github.com) to create your repository and upload files.
Create a new repository named system_engineering-devops.
Inside this repository, create a directory called 0x02-shell_redirections where all your script files for this project will be stored.
Adding Files for Each Task
Each task requires a unique script file. Create each script in the 0x02-shell_redirections directory, using the exact file names provided in each task description (e.g., 0-hello_world, 1-confused_smiley).
Submitting Your Project
Once all files are uploaded to the GitHub repository, verify that your directory structure and filenames match the requirements.
Using GitHub UI (Preferred Method)
You can easily upload files through GitHub’s web interface by clicking “Add file” > “Upload files” in your project directory.
For learners comfortable with the command line, feel free to use git commands to interact with GitHub.
