This project introduces learners to loops, conditional statements, and basic input parsing in Bash scripting. Learners will develop skills in using control flow to automate repetitive tasks and handle decision-making in scripts. Through hands-on tasks, students will practice with for, while, and until loops, create conditional logic with if, elif, else, and use parsing techniques for handling input data. By the end of the project, learners will be able to build more dynamic and responsive shell scripts.



Instructions
You should be able to see below the activity tasks mentioned in these instructions.
Complete the tasks one by one and follow the submission instructions below to submit your solution to the tasks.


How to Submit
Repository and Directory Setup
Ensure you have a GitHub account set up. If you are new to GitHub, use the GitHub website (https://github.com) to create your repository and upload files.
Create a new repository named system_engineering-devops.
Inside this repository, create a directory called 0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing where all your script files for this project will be stored.
Adding Files for Each Task
Each task requires a unique script file. Create each script in the 0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing directory, using the exact file names provided in each task description (e.g., 0-RSA_public_key.pub, 1-for_best_school).
Submitting Your Project
Once all files are uploaded to the GitHub repository, verify that your directory structure and filenames match the requirements.
Using GitHub UI (Preferred Method)
You can easily upload files through GitHub’s web interface by clicking “Add file” > “Upload files” in your project directory.
For learners comfortable with the command line, feel free to use git commands to interact with GitHub.


Auto-Checking Process
At the end of the submission deadline, the auto-checker will review the tasks for correctness and award points. Ensure each script functions as expected, follows the naming conventions, and includes required permissions.
Important!
All your files must have this as the first line. This will enable the checker to execute your files.
#!/bin/bash
